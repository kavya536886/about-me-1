I am a new student of the Fall 2019 batch pursuing my Masters of Applied Computer Science in NWMSU.

I have completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineer in Hyderabad, India in the year 2019. During my bachelor's I have also attended  class for languages like Java and python. Now I have entered into an other phase of my life by joining  NWMSU and looking forward to gain more knowledge regarding the programming languages.

After completion of my masters program I am really interested in working as a full stack developer. As I have recently completed my UG I am really looking forward to upgrade my skill set  and fit into this competitive world by getting hands on experience.
