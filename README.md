## About
This page is used to give information about me and a breif explanation about the tools and languages which are required for publishing a repository with GitHub pages.
## Recommended Tools
You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software.Initially to create a web page using gitHub pages you need a web browser with an active internet conncetion. When coming to the required  languages, most of hem are written in markdown language and in case of inconvenience  you can also use HTML tag in order to build a web page. We can also use CSS for styling the webpage your are trying to design.
So the most common web browser are
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- [Microsoft edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)
## Recommended Resources
As my major in under-graduation is Computer Science Engineering the basics of these languages are taught in regular classes and out of my curiosity towards coding I have fund some useful resources which I used as a reference when I faced any problem. Below are the resource that I refered when writing the code.
